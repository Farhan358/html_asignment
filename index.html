      <h4>Why I am learning Shopify?</h4>
      <p>
        As a tech enthusiast I always wants to learn new things. I stumbled upon
        shopify when I was randomly scrolling on the web, looking for a new
        trending technology. Shopify seems like pretty popular in foreign
        countries, where ready to go bussiness's are trying to setup a quick
        website for their bussiness.

      <h4>Why Shikhbe Shobai?</h4>
      <p>
        When I learned about Shopify I tried to find resources to learn more
        about it, But i couldn't find good resources to start learning about it.
        The documentation itself was not that user friendly. Then, one of my
        friend suggest me to check out sikhbe sobai shopify course. I checked
        the mentors profile and watch some of his free classes on youtube.Those
        classes makes me feel like, I can learn something from him. Hence I come
        to sikhbe sobai.
